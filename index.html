    <h1>Practical GitHub for Version Control<br>A Hands-on Session</h1>

    <p>
        Working with git Git is system designed some dummy text to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for the development of the Linux kernel. Git is known for its ability to track changes, maintain a comprehensive history of the project, and allow multiple developers to collaborate without interfering with each other’s work. One of Git's key features is branching, which allows developers to create independent lines of development. These branches can later be merged back into the main project, facilitating a seamless integration of new features or fixes. Git also supports lightweight tags, making it easy to mark important points in the history, like version releases. With its distributed nature, every developer has a full copy of the repository, including the entire history, ensuring that work can continue even if the central server is unavailable</p>

    <p>
        GitHub is a web-based platform that builds upon the capabilities of Git, providing a user-friendly interface and powerful collaboration tools for software development. It is the largest host of source code in the world and is widely used by both open-source and commercial projects. GitHub allows developers to host their repositories online, making it easier to share their work with others, contribute to existing projects, and manage collaborative efforts. One of GitHub’s most significant features is the pull request mechanism, which enables developers to propose changes to a project that can be reviewed, discussed, and merged by the project maintainers. This system facilitates code review and helps maintain the quality of the codebase. Additionally, GitHub provides robust issue tracking, enabling teams to log bugs, suggest enhancements, and manage project workflows efficiently    </p>
